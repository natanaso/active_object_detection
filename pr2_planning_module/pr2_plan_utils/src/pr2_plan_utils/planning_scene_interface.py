class PlanningSceneInterface:
    '''
    This class is a wrapper for the ROS planning scene.  

    The planning scene is used to allow the robot to plan
    in a different version of the world than the one that currently exists.  For example, if we wish to plan
    a series of arm movements, the second arm movement starts from the end of the first one rather than from the
    robot's current pose in the world.  More importantly, we may wish to plan a sequence of manipulations, which not
    only change the state of the robot but also the state of objects in the world.  All planners in ROS plan in
    the planning scene rather than in the current state of the world.

    However, the ROS planning scene is not set up for planning sequences of actions.  The ROS service call to 
    get_planning_scene returns the current state of the world, NOT the scene planners are currently using.  Likewise
    the service call to set_planning_scene_diff sets the planning scene from the current state of the world, not
    current planning scene.  This makes it very difficult to plan consecutive sequences of actions as it is
    incumbent on the user to maintain the diff from the current state of the world throughout the entire set
    of plans.
    
    Instead, this class maintains a running diff, allowing the user to continually update the state of the planning
    scene instead of remembering all changes from the current state of the world.  It is easy to reset the diff
    to reflect exactly the state of the world, but for every function call we have also provided a function call
    that can exactly undo it.  Note that although this class keeps track of your running changes, it is, in the 
    end, still sending a diff from the current world.  Therefore, if you make a change to the world (by publishing
    on the appropriate topic or using a WorldInterface) the planning scene will reflect that.

    When planning we must also be careful not to call TF as that reflects only the current state of the world.
    This inteface has a state transformer (see transform_state.py) that transforms frames according to the current
    robot state in the planning scene rather than in the world.  When planning you should always use the transform
    functions in the planning scene rather than calling TF.

    In many ways, this class looks like world_interface.py.  This was intentional to highlight that the planning
    scene operates just like the world will.  When making calls like add_object or attach_object_to_gripper to the
    planning scene during planning, you will make a lot of those same calls to the world interface during execution.

    The ROS planning scene is global; whenever it is set all planners are immediately updated to the new planning
    scene.  For this reason, we recommend that your planning scene interface also be global and that you use
    the get_planning_scene_interface call whenever you need an interface.  However, if you are very comfortable with
    the planning scene mechanism, you can maintain multiple interfaces corresponding to different sets of plans.

    For an example of using the planning scene interface, see arm_planner.py.

    Please note that this class is **NOT CURRENTLY THREADSAFE!**
    
    **Attributes:**

        **world_frame (string):** The frame in which objects are added to the collision map and also the frame in 
        which planning is done.  Usually this is /map, but if not using a map it will be /odom_combined.  It is 
        found by looking at the parent of the multi DOF joint in the robot state.

        **robot_frame (string):** The root frame of the robot's link tree.  This has the same orientation as the 
        world frame but moves with the robot.  Usually it is /base_footprint.  It is found by looking at the child 
        of the multi DOF joint in the robot state.

        **hands (dictionary):** Hand descriptions for the robot indexed by 'left_arm' and 'right_arm'.  For more
        information about hand descriptions, see hand_description.py

        **current_diff (arm_navigation_msgs.srv.SetPlanningSceneDiffRequest):** The current diff between the actual 
        state of the world and the planning scene.

        **set_scene (rospy.ServiceProxy):** The set_planning_scene_diff service
        
        **transformer (transform_state.TransformState):** The state transformer used for transforming between frames
        because TF reflects only the current state of the world.

        the end effector. Rather, now when the robot moves, the object is assumed to remain stationary with respect 
        to the robot's end effector instead of the world.  Collisions will be checked between the object and the 
        world as the object moves, but collisions between the object and the end effector will be ignored.  
        The link the object is attached to and the links with which collisions are ignored are defined by the hand 
        description (see hand_description.py).

        The object will be attached to the robot according to the current state of the robot and object in the 
        planning scene as maintained by this class (i.e. with any prior changes you made to the diff).

        To undo this function, you can use detach_object and add_object but you must remember the position of the
        object where it was originally attached!  If you call detach_and_add_back_attached_object, it will add
        the object back at its current location in the planning scene, NOT at the location at which it was

    def get_transform(self, to_frame, from_frame):
        '''
        All of the transform functions transform according to the robot state in the diff (or the current state of
        the world if you have not set a state in the diff).  

        This is because while planning, you cannot use TF as it
        reflects only the current state of the world.  Instead, you want to know what the transform will be given
        the state we expect the robot to be in.  You should always use these functions for transformation rather
        than TF while planning!
        
        This function follows the conventions of TF meaning that the transform returned will take the origin of 
        from_frame and return the origin of to_frame in from_frame.  For example, calling 
        get_transform(r_wrist_roll_link, base_link) will return the current position of the PR2's right wrist in the 
        base_link frame.

        Note that this is the INVERSE of the transform you would use to transform a point from from_frame to 
        to_frame.  Because this gets complicated to keep straight, we have also provided a number of 
        transfrom_DATATYPE functions.

        **Args:**

            **from_frame (string):** Frame to transform from

            **to_frame (string):** Frame to transform to
