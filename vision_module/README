OFFLINE PHASE:
1. Specify the names of the training objects in ./script/extract_tree_train_pcd

2. Make sure the view points in ./data/tree_vps.txt are correct

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Run ./script/extract_tree_train_pcd which will create the pcd files in ../database/cloud_data

4. Backup the old tree weights from ./data

5. roslaunch vision_module build_tree_database.launch

6. Specify the names of the objects for the observation model in ./script/build_obs_model

7. Make sure the view points in ./data/omap_vps.txt are correct

8. Run ./script/build_obs_model which will get the top scores for each viewpoint and save them in ./data/omap/oMap_objectname.txt

9. Use a matlab script to produce the final oMap



TODO:
	- Seems like we should not subsample and use the fpfh!!
	- pfh vs fpfh vs less keypoints vs subsample
	- voxelgrid: distorts cloud and complains "Euclidean distance between points is 0!" during feature calculation
	- randomsample: seems to remove too many points but might still work but our clounds are/should not be too big! We are concerned with accuracy!!
	- record distance with scores instead of 1-100 
	- setup a test framework for a single object to test active vs passive vision
